                        in the bus industry, redBus aims to attain the same success in the train industry as well. A

                        train ticket. When you view the details of your train ticket booking on the app or website, you
                        are presented with the option to either modify your booking or cancel the ticket. Click on the
                        option that best suits your travel needs. A small cancellation fee might be charged based on the
                        timing of your cancellation request.</p>

                    <p>You can complete your online train ticket booking by using any of the variety of payment options
                        that are available at your disposal. Customers can use any amount that’s remaining in their
                        redBus wallet, credit or debit cards, Wallets such as Amazon Pay or through UPI payment gateways

                        compensate any losses incurred by IRCTC, Railways, etc. Customers can opt for the “Free
                        Cancellation” policy by paying an extra amount at the time of booking. This comes in handy when
                        travel plans are not concrete.</p>
